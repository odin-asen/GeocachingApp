/**
 * description=none/user/html

 description = html:
 Cache descriptions are returned as HTML for all geocaches.

 description = user:
 Cache descriptions are returned as entered by the geocache owner entered it for all geocaches.

 description = none:
 Cache descriptions are not returned.

 Avoid fetching descriptions unless you really need the description for every geocache. Getting the geocache descriptions can triple (or more) the size of the returned data. When possible get a list of geocaches without descriptions, and then get the descriptions for individual geocaches as necessary.
